# CLIP-zero-shot-classification
This notebook is intended to show how OpenAI's new image classifier CLIP can be used to make zero shot classifications.  
This enables it to be used very cost efficiently in different industries.  
In addition to conventional sensors, CLIP could also be used to improve safety.
